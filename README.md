# Airport Ingolstadt Manching (ETSI) for Microsoft Flightsimulator 2020

I have created Ingolstadt Manching Airport (ETSI) because it is not in the sim. It is mostly created by eyeballing imagery, thus don't expect positions and sizes to be very accurate.

What is in the Package:
- both Runways
- a couple Taxiways
- civil general aviation parking
- additional vegetation
- additional lighting
- Tower frequency

What is missing:
- Patterns
- Instrument approaches (ILS etc.)
- Many buildings
- some surfaces (military parking, runways)
- ATC Taxi to Parking
