# Airport Ingolstadt Manching (ETSI) for Microsoft Flightsimulator 2020

I have created Ingolstadt Manching Airport (ETSI) because it is not in the sim. It is mostly created by eyeballing imagery, thus don't expect positions and sizes to be very accurate.

I did not touch the auto generated buildings. There are a lot missing and many are wrong. But I don't have access to the area and zero experience with 3D modeling. Maybe I'll add some more default buildings in the future to fill the gaps.

What is in the Package:
- both Runways
- a couple Taxiways
- civil general aviation parking
- additional vegetation
- additional lighting
- Tower frequency
- Thrilling roller coaster rides on the Taxiway ;-)

What is missing:
- Terraforming is still terrible in some parts
- edge lighting on the Taxiways
- Patterns
- Instrument approaches (ILS etc.)
- Many buildings
- some surfaces (military parking, runways)
